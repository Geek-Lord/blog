## Starting Out With My First Blog

Hello guys!

After so many years after I first had this thought, I finally have created a blog for myself. I was always worried thinking, "What if no one reads my blog?". But the truth is that: *I don't really care.*

This is just a new experience for me just so that I can grow and develop my own skills. That's also why I decided to build this all from scratch rather than going with something like Wordpress or Blogger. Point is that, this is just a learning experience for me.

I don't know how this blog is gonna shape up. I honestly don't even have any long term plans/goals for this blog. I'm just gonna go with the flow and see where this takes us!

So join in guys!

Best,

Sidharth.
