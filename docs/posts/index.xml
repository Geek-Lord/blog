      <description>Starting Out With My First Blog Hello guys!
After so many years after I first had this thought, I finally have created a blog for myself. I was always worried thinking, &amp;ldquo;What if no one reads my blog?&amp;rdquo;. But the truth is that: I don&amp;rsquo;t really care.
This is just a new experience for me just so that I can grow and develop my own skills. That&amp;rsquo;s also why I decided to build this all from scratch rather than going with something like Wordpress or Blogger.</description>
